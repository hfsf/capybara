# Sloth - A noobish, humble and umpretentious tool for process simulation using simultaneous equation solving

![](https://github.com/hfsf/sloth/blob/master/docs/imgs/sloth.png)

## Sloth aims to be:

* Simple, as the application scenario are intendly restricted (eg:process simulation using simultaneous equation solving)
* Easy to be extended, as a minimal working kernel is provided (Process connection, Degrees of Freedom Analysis, Support for external optimizers, etc)
* Humble, as the intent of this tool is to provide ground for further development from external developers in their own packages, or helping with Sloth project :)
