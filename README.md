# Sloth - A noobish, humble and umpretentious tool for process simulation using simultaneous equation solving

## Sloth aims to be:

* Simple, as the application scenario are intently restricted (eg:process simulation using simultaneous equation solving)
* Easy to be extended, as a minimal working kernel is provided (Process connection, Degrees of Freedom Analysis, Support for external optimizers, etc)
* Humble, as the intent of this tool is to provide ground for further development from external developers in their own packages, or helping with Sloth project :)
